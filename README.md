# Chaos or Clarity Research Project

![Chaos or Clarity](jpgq.gif "Chaos or Clarity")

Welcome to the "Chaos or Clarity" research project repository. This project focuses on sentiment analysis and data compilation for my thesis paper titled "[Chaos or Clarity: A Corpus-Assisted Analysis of Top Comments on Jordan Peterson's Controversial YouTube Videos.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Chaos%20or%20Clarity%3A%20A%20Corpus-Assisted%20Analysis%20of%20Top%20Comments%20on%20Jordan%20Peterson%27s%20Controversial%20YouTube%20Videos)" The full research paper is available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Chaos%20or%20Clarity%3A%20A%20Corpus-Assisted%20Analysis%20of%20Top%20Comments%20on%20Jordan%20Peterson%27s%20Controversial%20YouTube%20Videos).

## Python Scripts

In this repository, you will find a collection of Python scripts that are instrumental in the research project. Each script serves a specific role in contributing to the creation of the final dataset for the study. Two primary approaches are used for sentiment analysis:

- **VADER Sentiment Analysis:** This script utilizes the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool to gauge the sentiment of textual data.

- **TextBlob Sentiment Analysis:** The other script employs TextBlob, a natural language processing library, to perform sentiment analysis on the data.

These scripts play a crucial role in extracting sentiment information from textual data, which is a fundamental aspect of the research.

## Research Process

The research project involves various steps beyond sentiment analysis, including:

- **Data Pruning:** Data preprocessing and cleaning are essential to ensure that the dataset is of high quality and relevant to the research objectives.

- **Data Visualization:** Data visualization is employed to gain insights and present findings in a clear and comprehensible manner.
